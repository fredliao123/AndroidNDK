# android-ndk-swig-example
This project is a full example of using Android Studio (1.0+), Gradle (1.0+), NDK, and SWIG to automatically compile and setup C++ libraries and Java wrappers in Android Studio.

Explained in detail here: http://www.sureshjoshi.com/mobile/android-ndk-in-android-studio-with-swig/

Here are the from-scratch build steps (if you were going to build in your home directory on Linux/Mac - similar for Windows, with slightly revised commands and locations):

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/sureshjoshi/android-ndk-swig-example.git
    [Open in Android Studio and let Gradle run and the project get indexed - this creates local.properties and the sdk.dir]
    cd android-ndk-swig-example/NDKExample
    ./gradlew runSwig
    (In Android Studio) Make Project

That should build error-free (assuming youâ€™ve set up your ndk.dir in local.properties).

The dependencies are:

* [Android Studio (1.0+)](https://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)
* [Gradle Tools (1.0+)](https://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html#build-system)
* [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)
* [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)
